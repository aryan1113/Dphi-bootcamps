# Dphi-bootcamp-data-visualization
Got to know about Dphi via CAG-IITG, this bootcamp was particularly fun as the results were easy to understand.

Task-2 which I did was initially wrong, as I did not bother to check if I had to sort East Asian countries in descending order or ascending order.
I even thought of completing the numpy bootcamp, but things didn't pan out so well, couldn't complete all the tasks for that, so didn't submit the final assignment
